# Pokemon-Odyssey
Pokemon written in Java.

This project aims to recreate Pokemon games in Java. The game engine will be the main objective and priority while finishing the first Pokemon game, Pokemon Red/Gree/Blue, will be the end goal. 

I plan to add more content and story pertaining to different pokemon and events from movies and the series.

I hope to add at least 4 of the regions and will attempt to add all of them.
